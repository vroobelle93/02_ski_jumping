## Project goal and overview  

I can remember weekends full of nerves when whole families gathered to watch, what emerged to be a sociological phenomenon in early 2000's, a national tradition, 
something that joined truly whole country - the ski jumping competitions. As in this sport not only distance is relevant, but also style it was performed, 
this was always part of deep analysis of whole family to check, whether particular judges didn't harm "our jumpers".  
In this project I would like to gather data from couple of seasons and check, if hypothesis of some of my beloved family experts 
(*GERMAN JUDGE ALWAYS SCORES POLISH JUMPERS LOWER THAN HE SHOULD!!!111*) was right. This is my final project of statistics course in my postgraduate studies 
of Data Analysis and Data Science.  
  
This project consists of two main parts: Data acquisition and its analysis. 

## Motivation  
  
In this project I have learned some pretty useful skills:  
 - Data scraping - from .pdf files
 - SQLITE - Creating database and operating it from python project
 - SQL and pandas - data manipulation using them
 - Seaborn - creating various charts

## Possible upgrades
